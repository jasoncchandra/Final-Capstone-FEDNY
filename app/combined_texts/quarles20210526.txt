Thank you for inviting me to speak today.
Over the years, I have enjoyed working with many of the insurance regulators participating in this conference, and I look forward to the dayâ€”already very nearâ€”when we will again have such events in person.
The Federal Reserve has a closer connection to the insurance industry than most realize.
Insurance and insurers relate closely to the Federal Reserve's mission to provide the nation with a safe, flexible, and stable financial system.
Insurers play a crucial role in securing the safety and financial stability of American households.
Insurers also play a key role in many financial markets, including as among the largest investors in certain asset classes.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve arguably owes its creation, which followed the Panic of 1907, at least in part to the insurance industry.
Some scholars have argued that it was the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake that caused the Panic of 1907.1 The 1906 earthquake left over half of San Francisco homeless.
Such widespread destruction of one of the country's largest cities had a commensurate effect on the economy and insurance industry.
Fearing that the U.S. financial markets could not absorb that many dollars in asset sales, many European insurers paid claims by withdrawing money from foreign banks and shipping gold across the Atlantic.
The Bank of England's gold supply accordingly dropped 14 percent.
It responded to this gold outflow with measures that contributed to the panic and, after an admittedly long chain of events, led to my being here today.
Of course, now we have a different financial system and better means to coordinate an international response to such events.
One of these mechanisms is the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which I chair.
Insurance continues to be an important part of the FSB's mission in collaboration with other governments and organizations, particularly the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
So today, I would like to highlight a few of the Federal Reserve's priorities on insurance regulation and supervision, both domestically and internationally.
COVID Event Monitoring and Response One priority has been monitoring the impact on the insurance industry of what I refer to as the COVID event.
And so far, the insurance sector has performed very well.
Insurers entered the pandemic with strong capital levels, and the industry has not seen any large defaults.
Insurance risk managers and regulators should be proud of this performance.
The COVID event has also affected financial markets.
The Fed continues to monitor these effects, including the impact on life insurers of sustained low interest rates.
The long duration of some insurance products, paired with embedded policyholder options, can make it difficult to match cash flows and can create interest rate risk.
Additionally, some savings products can be difficult for insurers to market when only returns of near 0 percent can be profitably guaranteed.
And the COVID event has posed some challenges for supervisors.
Social distancing has changed how financial products are distributed, how we supervise financial institutions, and how we collaborate in the regulatory community.
For example, though both the IAIS and FSB have worked intensively at a distanceâ€”there is an FSB meeting of one sort or another every day of every weekâ€”it has been over a year since the IAIS or FSB has met in person.
Capital Currently the Board's most significant project with respect to insurance and our role in supervision is the development of a capital rule for insurance depository institution holding companies, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
We have engaged in a thorough and deliberative process in developing an appropriate capital rule, which has included both an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and a more recent proposal that we invited comment on.
This deliberative approach is working well.
Most of the comments we received on the proposal, which we're calling the Building Block Approach, or BBA, were supportive of both our process and the overall regulatory framework we proposed.
And we are currently reviewing these comments and intend to publish a final rule soon.
As we near the completion of this journey, I'd like to recap why we chose to propose the Building Block Approach, which adjusts and aggregates existing legal-entity capital requirements to produce an enterprise-wide capital requirement.
The BBA is meant to address one of our biggest challenges in supervising companies that engage in both banking and insurance operations, which is how different these businesses are.
No single, uniform approach to capital regulation is appropriate for companies in both sectors.
The banking capital framework would not appropriately assess the capitalization of insurers.
It is primarily based on risk-weighted assets.
This framework would not capture many of insurers' liability risks, such as from natural catastrophes.
Nor would any existing insurance capital rule appropriately assess the risks of a bank.
So rather than trying to create a single capital framework that would work for all types of financial institutions, we decided to propose an aggregation approach that incorporates approaches developed specifically for each type of institution and its risks.
The BBA uses the existing and time-tested frameworks that have been tailored specifically to measure appropriately particular risks.
It assesses insurance risks using an insurance capital framework and banking risks using our banking capital framework.
The suitability of such an aggregation approach for regulating the capital of a large, internationally active insurance group is being debated currently at the IAIS, as I will discuss in a moment.
While there are disagreements at the margins, there are also many areas of agreement on the appropriate uses of an aggregation approach.
The IAIS's Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) for internationally active insurance groups itself uses an aggregation approach to incorporate non-insurance risks.
And at the other extreme, there is also agreement that it would not be appropriate to calculate the capital position of a large bank holding company that is not engaged in insurance by aggregating the capital positions of certain subsidiary banks and legal entities.
A key issue in the international debate about the ICS is whether products, capital markets, and laws vary so much by country or region that a single, unified methodology cannot measure risk accurately.
Are the differences in international insurance markets more like the significant differences between banking and insurance or like the less fundamental differences in the banking business models internationally?
If the differences are large enough, a one-size-fits-all methodology could produce unintended consequences, send false signals to regulators or capital markets, and ultimately be destabilizing.
The Insurance Policy Advisory Committee, or IPAC, is currently studying this issue by looking at the impact of a hypothetical adoption of the IAIS' Insurance Capital Standard on the U.S. industry, markets, and consumers.
The IPAC is a 21-member advisory committee that was established by Congress in 2018 to advise the Board on international insurance capital standards and other insurance issues.
The group is currently performing research on the potential impact of the Insurance Capital Standardâ€”specifically on U.S. life and retirement productsâ€”and hopes to complete a review on this in the coming months.
And I'm looking forward to seeing the result.
For those that would like to contribute as a member of the IPAC, the IPAC will shortly be accepting applications.
In addition to the Insurance Policy Advisory Committee, we're also working with the states and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which I want to congratulate on adopting a model law related to their Group Capital Calculation (GCC) at the end of last year.
We coordinated with the states and the NAIC to ensure that there would not be unnecessary duplication and burden between our two capital frameworks.
While the Building Block Approach and Group Capital Calculation cannot be exactly aligned due to reasons that include our different legal mandates and restrictions, this collaboration has been successful.
As one example, no group will be subject to both the BBA and GCC.
Instead, the Fed and the states will share information on groups we both supervise.
This reduces unnecessary burden on firms while still allowing appropriate supervision.
Our close coordination with the states, the NAIC, and also the Federal Insurance Office extends to international policy development at the IAIS.
The members of "Team USA," as we refer to this group, work together to advocate for the United States internationally.
One important international project that I have already mentioned is the ICS.
Two years ago, the ICS reached a milestone when the IAIS membership adopted ICS version 2.0 for use in a five-year monitoring period.
The purpose of this monitoring period is to evaluate the functionality and performance of the ICS.
Team USA has argued that as currently constructed, the ICS would not be appropriate as a capital rule for U.S. internationally active insurance groups.
Its market adjusted valuation approach could introduce significant volatility into the capital measure and capital requirement, which could lead to procyclical economic effects and harm the ability of insurers to provide long-term savings products.
Accordingly, Team USA and other interested jurisdictions continue to build on our work on the Group Capital Calculation and Building Block Approach to develop what the IAIS terms the Aggregation Method, which could be considered an equivalent implementation of a group capital rule for large, internationally active insurers in the United States.
To accomplish that, Team USA is currently working with other IAIS members to develop criteria to assess whether the Aggregation Method and ICS have a sufficient level of comparability.
These criteria are planned to be released by the IAIS for public comment at the end of this year or early next year.
As I have mentioned, it is uncertain what the potential impact of the IAIS' ICS on markets might be and whether the ICS, after any changes, will ultimately be suitable for adoption in the U.S.
These issues are being studied, but the COVID event has affected this work.
The number of participating firms decreased in response to the COVID event.
Data analysis planned by the IAIS has been interrupted.
The Fed would like to see the monitoring period extended by a year or longer given the unforeseen and unavoidable delays of the last year.
This would allow for completing the originally intended analysis and incorporating any needed design changes.
The Federal Reserve continues to advocate for the IAIS to have a transparent process that allows for meaningful opportunities for public comment in all its work.
Supervisory Framework I'd also like to mention another project that we have been working on here at home.
We are developing a tailored supervisory framework for the insurance savings and loan holding companies (ISLHCs) that we supervise.
Our development of this framework recognizes that the risks of ISLHCs are different than other banking organizations.
This supervisory framework, which we plan to publish for public comment later this year, will describe our tailored expectations for these firms, how we will rate them, and how we rely on the work of state insurance supervisors to avoid duplication and undue burden.
Climate Change Finally, climate change is another emerging risk that we are monitoring.
Broad climate policy is the role of Congress and other federal agencies, not the Federal Reserve.
The Board, however, expects all firms that it supervises, including insurance savings and loan holding companies, to manage all material risks, whatever the sourceâ€”which can include climate risk.
The insurance industry has been at the forefront of work to better understand climate-related financial risks, including through climate change modeling.
While the Federal Reserve relies on fellow prudential regulators to supervise specific ISLHC entities, we also recognize that insurers have much to offer in understanding an emerging area of focus for the broader financial sector.
Conclusion That is a brief summary of the Fed's work relating to the insurance industry.
Our involvement with the industry is longstanding, reflecting insurance's central role in financial markets and its importance in helping households and businesses manage their risks.
That involvement deepened after the global financial crisis, when Congress gave us additional responsibility for supervising certain insurers.
More recently, our involvement has included verifying that these insurers are capable of dealing with the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID event.
Another new challenge is understanding and ensuring that firms account for climate-related financial risks.
And a central part of the Fed's agenda is working with other regulators and the industry to devise an appropriate approach to regulating capitalâ€”one that recognizes the unique role of insurance in the financial system and the distinctions between insurance companies and banks.
Our deliberate process has helped build confidence among regulators and the industry and is bringing us to consensus.
The public, which depends on a strong and stable insurance sector, has been well-served by that process and will benefit from the outcome.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.
I look forward to engaging with you all in the future.

May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.
Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy.1 After the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery.
Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our market-based economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support.
Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rateâ€“sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year.
With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next year.
Inflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent primarily as a result of three factors: the surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation of 12-month inflation.
For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that recent boost to inflation will be transitory, and that it will not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed's maximum-employment goal.
We've come a long way since last spring, but reopenings over the past year have been uneven, so it will still be some time before we repair all the economic damage.
Supply bottlenecks will likely hinder the quick expansion of production in some industries in the next few months and raise some costsâ€”in some cases significantly.
The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports.
But even with those impediments, I believe the strong recovery will keep rolling forward.
Let me walk through the evidence for that optimistic view.
First, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that a broad reopening can proceed safely.i The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social-distancing recommendations for vaccinated people.2 Although local COVID-19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part time and more than half of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments.
More than a dozen more states are planning to do so over the coming weeks.
With these reopenings, consumer spending, which is two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), will remain robust, supported by personal income that has, thanks to significant fiscal support, now surpassed the trend it was on before the COVID event.
April's retail sales results were flat, but that came after enormous gains in March that were boosted by the latest round of stimulus checks.
Looking beyond the headline numbers, sales were up 13 percent in March and 3 percent in April at restaurants and bars, one of the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 event.
April and March were the third- and fourth-best months for vehicle sales to consumers in U.S. history, if you filter out sales to car rental companies, a sector just beginning to recover.
You might expect this bounce will subside after consumption regains the strong trend it was on pre-COVID-19, but one reason I think it will continue is the still high rate at which people have been adding to their savings.
Even as personal consumption expenditures rose at a huge 10 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2021, the saving rate averaged 21 percent over those three months.
Again, a lot of that reflected the most recent round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated stock of savings will support spending for many months to come.
Business investment took a big hit in the first half of 2020 but has come back strongly and is now running above pre-pandemic levels.
Current indicators of business spending are pointing to continued elevated levels of investment in the months ahead.
Supply bottlenecks have depleted inventories for many goods and rebuilding those inventories will be an important supplement for business spending and factory output.
I see two potential headwinds for the economy: the uneven global recovery and the aforementioned supply bottlenecks.
Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time.
Supply bottlenecks are more prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth.
Although I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, the picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending.
The unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent pre-COVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs.
Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
My optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in overall labor demandâ€”by many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year.
In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for March, private-sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to 5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series set in November 2018.
Job growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines: For those who were working, average hours increased; the number of people working part time because they couldn't find full-time jobs decreased significantly; and wage growth was very strong.
The underlying strength in hours and wages lends support to widespread reports that worker shortages are impeding hiring.
Labor force participation remains about 3â€‘1/2 million people lower than before COVID-19.
Among the many factors driving this shortage, as indicated by the Federal Reserve's report Economic Well-Being of U.S.
Households in 2020, is parents who need to care for their children because of remote school and aftercare.3 We have also seen a wave of retirements by older workers in the past year.
And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work.
But those benefits are slated to expire over the summer, and I hope that a fuller reopening of schools in the fall will ease the pressure on parents.
The spike in retirements may well moderate in a stronger economy, as we saw in the year or two before the pandemic.
So, while labor shortages could weigh on job creation in coming months, I don't yet perceive this development as significantly slowing the U.S. economy beyond the next few months.
Now let's turn to the other half of the Federal Reserve's economic goals, inflation.
As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony, I agree with the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent rise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors.
I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022.
Market-implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most survey measures are sending similar signals.
Therefore, I consider these recent increases in inflation expectations a welcome development, reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC's new policy framework.
That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside, relative to my baseline forecast.
Broadly speaking, there are three reasons for this.
First, there are wage pressures.
A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn in wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade.
Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs.
It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact.
Some of this surprising outcome reflects temporarily lower labor force participation coming out of the enormous economic shock last spring, but some of the Fed's business contacts have said that shortages of skilled laborersâ€”particularly in manufacturing, transportation, and constructionâ€”predated COVID-19 and are likely to persist.
Another factor that I referred to earlierâ€”fiscal policyâ€”carries potential costs as well as obvious benefits.
Even as the huge amount of stimulus money in people's pockets has been boosting income and spending in eye-popping ways, much of that stimulus was saved.
A larger-than-expected or faster release of those accumulated savings while the economy is already growing rapidly could result in output exceeding potential output by more than it has in decades.
It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID event.
But, at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations.
That outcome aligns with the advice of those in the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt, at least in countries with low interest rates, than they used to be.4 In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP.5 By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP.6 Further fiscal policy actions are, of course, the purview of the Congress and the Administration.
History tells us that once the dreadnought of government spending gathers speed, it is difficult and slow to turn around.
Surely the deficits being run to offset the COVID-related shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the years ahead.
And, finally, recent monthly readings on import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices have all come in above consensus expectations.
These upside surprises cannot be attributed to base effects.
It is true that many of the factors driving the April consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time.
But clearing some of those supply disruptions will require additional investment and the time to expand production capacity.
If these shortages persist into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make above-target inflation more persistent than we currently expect.
I don't want to overstate my concernâ€”I am not worried about a return to the 1970s.
We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore, lower interest rates.
One of those differences is that the kinds of "wage-price spirals" that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time.
It's quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.
So, what are the implications for monetary policy?
I am fully committed to the FOMC's new monetary policy framework and the two pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework.
The conditions required to change the pace of asset purchases and those required to increase the federal funds rate are sequential: The latter requires improvement in the economy that clears a much higher bar.
Let me address each of those in turn.
The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
My personal view is that the rise in inflationâ€”even after discounting temporary factorsâ€”and inflation expectations since December will prove sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year, but improvement in the labor market has been slower than I would have liked.
For instance, the unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting.
Therefore, we need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices and wages so long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longer-run inflation goal.
For me, it is a question of risk management.
The best analysis we currently have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary.
But those of us on the FOMC are economists and lawyers, not prophets, seers and revelators.
We could be wrong; and what happens then?
Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target.
If we're wrong, we know how to bring inflation down.
But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.
If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, then, as noted in the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.
In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.
This standard presents inherent communications challenges because it cannot be summarized by a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee's interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013.
In contrast, the time for discussing a change in the federal funds rate remains in the future.i The guidance for the federal funds rate commits to maintain the current rate until labor market conditions are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
In the FOMC's most recent Summary of Economic Projections, no participantsâ€”even those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I've outlined todayâ€”thought it appropriate that liftoff occur before 2022.
Perhaps even more important than the timing of liftoff will be the expected trajectory of rate increases afterward, and you can see that even among participants with an earlier expected liftoff, those paths are quite shallow.
Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time.
Let me conclude with a few thoughts on financial stability.
As the Fed's most recent Financial Stability Report notes, the bright outlook, ample supply of credit, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy have pushed some asset valuations to very high levels that could be subject to sharp reversals if expectations are not met.
Likewise, business debt is high relative to past experience, which is a good reason to carefully weigh the risks.
But the strong economy reassures me here: Earnings are growing, many businesses have ample stockpiles of cash, expected bond defaults are below their long-run medians, and the pace of credit rating downgrades has slowed to a trickle.
When I think about financial stability, I think most directly about resilience to shocks, and it would be hard to imagine a better test of that resilience than what occurred in the spring of 2020.
Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves, all without significant strains to their overall health.
The largest banks at the core of the financial system are better capitalized than they have been in decades, and these institutions are sitting on large amounts of highly liquid assets while relying on relatively low levels of short-term funding.
The banking sector is strong.
I also see a resilient household sector.
Household credit is primarily owed by borrowers with prime credit scores, rising home prices have most homeowners flush with equity, and, as I noted earlier, households are sitting on a large stock of savings.
It is true that there are structural vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, particularly money funds and hedge funds, and these are being scrutinized by U.S. and international authorities, including the Financial Stability Board under my chairmanship.7 But I believe these risks are manageable, and I come down on the side of the research that concludes these and other concerns are best addressed by targeted financial regulation and supervision rather than the blunt tool of monetary policy.8 At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID-19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth.
Before ending, I'd like to reemphasize that I am quite optimistic about the path of the economy.
While prices will run above our 2 percent target this year, I believe most of this increase will be transitory.
After an exceedingly difficult year, we are poised to enter a robust and durable expansion.

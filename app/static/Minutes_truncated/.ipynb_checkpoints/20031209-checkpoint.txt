 developments,          members referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic          expansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched. The members noted          that spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of          tax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane. And with business confidence          on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had          revived. While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of          the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected          growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets          over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors          supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies,          accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence,          a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker          dollar and pickup in growth abroad. While downside risks to the outlook          had diminished, some members remained concerned that spending could slow          somewhat next year as the effects of fiscal stimulus and mortgage refinancing          faded. Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and          so weigh on consumer confidence. With relatively strong economic growth          nonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation          as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year.        In their comments about recent developments around the nation, members          reported improving economic conditions in virtually all regions, with          strength in household spending increasingly augmented by gains in business          outlays. Consumer spending remained firm, and residential construction          continued at a high level. Committee members' business contacts generally          expressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained,          and they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment          going forward. Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in          the rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors          and employment displayed signs of stabilizing. Some members reported an          easing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal          reports suggested that competition, including especially competition from          foreign producers, continued to constrain pricing.        In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the          economy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in          business spending in recent quarters would continue. It now appeared that          the increase in outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter          was even larger than had been thought, and data on orders and shipments,          as well as anecdotal reports, pointed to further increases. These gains          owed to rising business confidence, substantial gains in profits and cash          flow, and accommodative financial markets. In addition, businesses were          expected to step up investment outlays next year in advance of the expiration          of temporary tax incentives. Some members noted that the commercial real          estate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling          rents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted          demand for office and retail space.        An easing of business caution was also suggested by growing indications          that business firms were shifting from inventory liquidation to restocking.          With the level of inventories still quite low relative to sales and sales          expected to strengthen further, a number of members noted that inventory          investment could be expected to contribute to growth in aggregate demand          in coming quarters.        Household spending had remained solid even as the effects of tax refunds          and mortgage refinancing, which had boosted spending substantially in          the summer, waned. While consumption spending had slowed earlier in the          fall, retail contacts suggested some strengthening more recently and reported          that holiday sales appeared to be running somewhat above last year's pace.          Looking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported          by further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in          the first half of next year. And with the expansion picking up momentum,          the risk of a slowdown in such spending clearly seemed to have diminished.          Some members pointed, however, to signs of increased financial stress          that could limit the ability of many households to hold spending at recent          levels, especially if incomes did not rise at a robust pace in line with          current forecasts. In the housing sector, activity remained elevated despite          some increase in mortgage rates since early summer.        Members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which          had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would          slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases          in state and local spending. Although fiscal policy more generally would          probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect          was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were          likely to persist. Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern          about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets          and the economy.        In their remarks about the external sector of the economy, members noted          that an improvement in the economic outlook in many foreign economies,          as well as the lower dollar, was likely to foster a pickup in exports.          While some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster          growth in the United States, domestic demand in several major trading          partners appeared to be strengthening. Nonetheless, the value of U.S.          imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin,          and the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction          added to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy.        In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated          that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods          markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with          a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct          possibility. Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on          prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently          quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which          would reduce labor costs. In addition, some members noted that the current          unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since          the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late,          and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level          of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages.          However, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation          were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and          the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced          weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small          - was now regarded by most as virtually nil. Indeed, the weaker dollar,          higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were          seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices          even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had          not had a large effect on retail prices in the past. Members also expressed          concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations          given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that          seemed to be gathering momentum. Some noted that the rise in recent months          in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields          on nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in          this direction. Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered          the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on          the downside for the next few quarters.        In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead,          all the members favored an unchanged policy that continued to incorporate          a target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The data and anecdotal          evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members          more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.          Nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance          remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation,          wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable          uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down.          In these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain          subdued well into the future. To be sure, the Committee needed to remain          attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared          to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted          such a move. At some point, a move in the direction of a less accommodative          and more neutral policy posture might well be necessary should the apparently          vigorous expansion continue and over time promote fuller utilization of          resources. For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit          in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking          preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation,          with associated costs to economic performance.        In their discussion of the announcement to be issued shortly after this          meeting, the members agreed that in addition to updating to reflect recent          economic developments, some rewording was needed to reflect their evolving          assessment of the risks to the economy. In light of the recent acceleration          in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth          ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed          assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had          diminished appreciably. While a number of members saw some slight further          disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material          change in inflation. All could agree that the risks of further disinflation          were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.          In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no          longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks          to growth and inflation taken together.        Views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining          an accommodative monetary policy "for a considerable period." A number          of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's          flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed          appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances. A majority,          however, preferred to retain the phrase, at least for now. They noted          that the changes in their assessment of risk would convey the evolving          views of the Committee and they believed the "considerable period" reference          still accurately conveyed the Committee's policy intentions. Given the          decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit          in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically          the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed          to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.

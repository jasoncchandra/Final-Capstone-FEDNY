 at this meeting suggests      that the economy has been growing rather slowly in      recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to      expand moderately in December, and the civilian      unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent.  Industrial      production increased only slightly further in the      fourth quarter.  Growth of consumer spending was      modest, on balance, over the past several months.      Housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable      October decline.  Orders for nondefense capital goods      point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on      business equipment, and nonresidential construction has      risen appreciably further.  The nominal deficit on U.S.      trade in goods and services narrowed in October from      its average rate in the third quarter.  There has been      no clear change in underlying inflation trends.        	Most market interest rates have declined somewhat      since the Committee meeting on December 19.  In foreign      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen      further over the intermeeting period.        	Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and      January.  From the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth      quarter of 1995, M2 expanded in the upper half of its      range and M3 grew at the upper end of its range.      Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been      moderate in recent months, placing this aggregate near      the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.        	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary      and financial conditions that will foster price stabil-      ity and promote sustainable growth in output.  In      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of      1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively,      measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth      quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for growth of      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7      percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light      of progress toward price level stability, movements in      their velocities, and developments in the economy and      financial markets.        	In the implementation of policy for the immediate      future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,      taking account of a possible reduction in the discount      rate.  In the context of the Committee's long-run      objectives for price stability and sustainable economic      growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,      financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater      reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint      would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.  The      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over      coming months.   Votes for short-run policy:  Messrs.
